# Annam Soil Nutrients Laboratory
## INTRODUCTION
	India being an agriculture country, its economy predominantly depends on agriculture yield growth and agro-industry products. In India, farming is done by traditional method, 
        farmerâ€™s plant crops traditionally without knowing the content of soil and quality of that soil. As a result farmers will not gain sufficient profit from their farming. The 
        existing method of soil testing is manual method which starts by taking soil samples and then sends to laboratories for testing. This manual process is time consuming and not 
        so feasible. Due to human intervention there are chances of human errors so farmers may receive incorrect report. So there is need of automated process for soil testing and 
        crop prediction. Testing of soil is important because soil testing helps to determine fertility of soil and thus crop prediction can be done. So we proposed a system which 
        will have a handheld device which gives pH value and we will estimate Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) from the pH of that soil. We are using classification 
        algorithm to predict suitable crops based on the values we get from our device and we will also provide suitable fertilizers required for that land within the particular time 
        as the nutrients of the soil wont change. The aim of our laboratory is to develop and design a database that would  increase the yield production by testing the nutrients of 
        the soil and seeds within the proper pH level. This database also keeps record of the farmers with their soil and seed samples which has been tested in out laboratory.
## Functionalities of our laboratory:
	In Annam Laboratory, there are many sectors like fertility check department, seed life span department, pH value sector, nutrients percentage calculation, climate change 
        variables and electrical conductivity calculator of the soil. The database presents district level data, as districts are the smallest administrative units in India at which 
        consistent and reliable data is available. As many as 271 districts, covering 13 major states in India, constitute the database. Agricultural data covered in our database 
        include, among other variables, area planted, production and farm harvest prices for five major and fifteen minor crops. Areas under irrigated and high-yielding varieties 
        (HYV) is provided for the major crops. Data on agricultural inputs, such as, fertilizers, bullocks and tractors - in both quantity and price terms - is also provided. Other 
        variables covered are agricultural labour, cultivators, wages and factory earnings, rural population and literacy proportion. Meteorological station level climate data has 
        been used to generate district specific climate using sophisticated surface interpolation techniques. Similarly, soil data, compiled through various tables and maps, is also 
        included in our database. The farmer comes with the soil sample should report it in the main desk where the type of the soil, life span of the soil, place where it came from 
        etc., such details are collected. After going through many testing and documenting the pH level, amount of nutrients present in  the soil, crops that could be yielded in the 
        soil, time period of the nutrients present in the soil, climate that suits the soil where given as results.
  
**Modules in the system:**

- Maintains a proper crop dataset.
- Daily updation with the meteorological department.
- A clear dataset about the farmers with their samples.
- Notification system by indicating the farmers during the climatic change.
- Pricing system for the fertilizers and crops.
- Maintains a webpage with adequate information about the soil nutrients and agriculture.
- Report generation.

## Benefits of the system:
	
        In this digital world each and every sector is undergoing a dramatic change due to IT field. But, in agriculture field, till date not much work has been done. Through our 
        laboratory a farmer will be able to get details regarding required fertilizers from his soil sample. This is used to improved crop production with reduction in cost of 
        fertilizer and thus improves the agriculture sector in India. The data is collected in the database regarding crop details and soil conditions which provides total fertilizer 
        requirements
